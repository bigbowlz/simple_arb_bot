Project Description\n","\n","The Simple Arb Bot is an exploratory project that shows how an arbitrage implementation monitors asset prices across exchanges on the blockchain, and executes trades for the same pair of asset on different markets to gain a low-risk price-difference profit. \n","\n","The project sets up a locally-run fork of the Ethereum blockchain, and simulates real-world trading dynamics through procedurally-generated trades of random sizes based on different trader profiles. Through the implementation, the Simple Arb Bot successfully demonstrates the end-to-end flow of price monitoring, opportunity detection, and on-chain execution, and serves as a valuable eductaional source to explore blockchain interactions and development."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["## II. Background and Motivation\n","\n","Arbitrage is a trading strategy that involves taking advantage of price discrepancies of the same asset in different markets or forms to make a profit without risk. The core idea is to buy low in one market and sell high in another simultaneously, thereby capitalizing on the price difference. \n","\n","With the rise of blockchain technology, decentralized exchanges (DEXes) have seen tremendous growth. The top 10 DEXs, including Uniswap, Curve, and PancakeSwap, had a combined trading volume of $66.6 billion in Q2 2023. The price discrepancies of assets across these different DEX markets thus become huge arbitrage opportunities that I'm interested in exploring.\n","\n","This project aims to develop an automated arbitrage bot for Uniswap V2 DEXes and profit from the price differences of the same asset in different DEX markets. This bot will collect live price of a list of assets from on-chain smart contracts, and make informed decisions about when to execute simultaneous arbitrage transactions. The ultimate goal is to profit from these transactions while contributing to the overall efficiency and balance of DeFi markets by aligning prices across different markets or exchanges.

Automated Market Maker (AMM) Exchanges use smart contracts to create liquidity pools, where users can trade against the pool rather than matching with another user.

In the context of an arbitrage trade, slippage refers to the price change between the time an arbitrage opportunity is spotted and the time the arbitrage trade is finalized on-chain. Slippage can occur due to various factors, including low liquidity, high volatility, or delays in transaction processing.\n","   \n","   - Liquidity: <br>\n","      AMMs rely on liquidity pools to facilitate trades. If a liquidity pool has a small amount of an asset, large trades can significantly impact the price, leading to higher slippage.

Users can set a **gas price** for their transaction, where a higher gas price means higher resulting gas cost, but faster processing time of their transaction; a lower gas price means saving on transaction costs, but risking too long to complete the transaction and losing the arbitrage opportunity. Thus, an arbitrageur must always be looking for the best blockchain transaction price, balancing cost and speed.\n","<br>\n","<br>\n","\n","1. **Concurrency**<br>\n","   Trades must be executed as fast as possible to capture the price difference opportunity of an asset.

However, this is highly dependent on market conditions, strategy, and transaction costs. \n","\n","    While my simple arb bot implementation currently achieves 1261% * 24 * 2 * 365 = 22,092,720% in APY, these performance results cannot be compared as the variables and environment were configured entirely differently. \n","    \n","    However, the online references provide some insights into the profitability of arbitrage trade bots: with a small investment, we could usually see really high return that reaches several times the original investment, but scalability is limited in a single strategy, so in future iterations, it's worth combining a set of trading strategies together to respond more dynamically to market changes.\n","\n","2. Execution Speed\n","   \n","    Latency is one of the most important factors in on-chain arbitrage trades, as transactions are subject to attacks when they reside in the mempool. The mempool is a publicly open pool of transactions that are yet to be mined and not finalized on-chain. There are bots specfically targeting the mempool for transactions that are profitable, and conduct Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) attacks to execute trades against them.\n","\n","    Although my arbitrage bot is able to achieve milisecond performance in the test environment, for real-world on-chain transactions, finality usually takes more than 12 seconds (which is the current block generation time)or even minutes when there's congestion. Through research, I have noticed that there are certain protocols and applications that are built to bypass the mempool during arbitrage trades, resulting in miliseconds in latency as the transactions can be finalized/mined immediately after submission. Such protocols include Flashbots. \n","\n","    Other attempts to avoid latency in on-chain finality include designs that batch transactions and match orders without directly exposing them to the public mempool, and Cowswap is a representative application that implemented trade matching.\n","\n","    \n","\n","### Next Steps for Benchmarking\n","There are paid arbitrage bot implementations which I am planning to use for future profitability benchmarking and optimization references, including https://wundertrading.com/en/account/subscription/pricing.\n","\n","The research findings on arbitrage implementations that try to avoid latency also provide guidance on future research and integrations between my arbitrage bot and protocols like Flashbot and Cowswap to improve on finality speed."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["## VII.

Learnings\n","\n","The Simple Arb Bot is a great learning experience that taught me blockchain development basics, honed my python coding skills, and most importantly, trained me to solve problems in all kinds of error scenarios interacting with new coding languages, libraries, and frameworks. \n","\n","This is my first CS project that involves blockchain development. Through this project, I explored important toolings in blockchain development like the HardHat development framework and the web3.py Python libraries to interact with blockchain; I also started to code in Solidity and JavaScript, the two most commonly used languages in the blockchain development ecosystem. However, as many of these toolings are recently built, there aren't many experiences shared online for debugging and working around limitations, so figuring out how to solve an issue that derived from these toolings became the biggest trunk of my work in the actual development. This was a tough and time-consuming experience, but it's rewarding because I learned valuable problem-solving skills that will help me with future explorations with any new library or framework. I found that reading the documentation details and the code implementation itself has been helpful in understanding the uses of a library or framework function. I also became more experienced in identifying the root cause of a bug through traceback logs.\n","\n","Developing a bot that can monitor and interact with multiple exchanges and contracts simultaneously also helped me gain deeper knowledge of how blockchain networks, smart contracts and DEXes work. It gave me a chance to look into the economic and functional designs of top blockchain exchanges, and gain insights into financial concepts like arbitrage, market making, and liquidity provision. Understanding these is valuable not just in blockchain, but also in fintech and traditional finance sectors. While trying to get the contract ABIs from the production Ethereum blockchain, I learned to interact with APIs, which taught me the fundamentals of HTTP protocols. This knowledge is transferable to many areas of software development.\n","\n","As the project is mostly built in Python, I tried to for the first time employ OOP design principles in the Python language, and modeled the arbitrage bot as a class that allows me to easily access the smart contract functions and blockchain utility features. The choice of encapsulation not only helped with tweaking bot configurations with different setups to optimize performance, but further proved to be helpful in running multiple trader instances for different trade profiles.\n","\n","There are many limitations in my bot implementation, and the current state of strategy design and code implementation is far from production-ready. However, the current implementation successfully demonstrates the end-to-end flow of an arbitrage bot in a simulated dynamic trading environment, and provides a solid foundation for a production-use bot to be built on top of. In my future iterations, I'm planning to focus on the following to improve the bot:\n","- diversify trading strategies for better scalibility and opportunity capture in different market conditions\n","- utilze searching and sorting algorithms for faster arb opportunity capture\n","- integrate with existing bot frameworks or platforms to improve on latency\n","- benchmark production bot implementations to understand profitability performance and reverse-engineer their stragegy through on-chain events\n","\n","By working on a blockchain arbitrage bot project, I gained hands-on experience that ties together theory and practice across multiple areas of computer science, programming, and blockchain technology. I hope to keep exploring the topic of arbitrage and extend the opportunity capture of my bot to more types of decentralized financial applications in future interations such as derivatives and basis trading."]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.12.4"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":2}
