Project Description"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["## II. Background and Motivation\n","\n","Arbitrage is a trading strategy that involves taking advantage of price discrepancies of the same asset in different markets or forms to make a profit without risk. The core idea is to buy low in one market and sell high in another simultaneously, thereby capitalizing on the price difference. \n","\n","With the rise of blockchain technology, decentralized exchanges (DEXes) have seen tremendous growth. The top 10 DEXs, including Uniswap, Curve, and PancakeSwap, had a combined trading volume of $66.6 billion in Q2 2023. The price discrepancies of assets across these different DEX markets thus become huge arbitrage opportunities that I'm interested in exploring.\n","\n","This project aims to develop an automated arbitrage bot for Uniswap V2 DEXes and profit from the price differences of the same asset in different DEX markets. This bot will collect live price of a list of assets from on-chain smart contracts, and make informed decisions about when to execute simultaneous arbitrage transactions. The ultimate goal is to profit from these transactions while contributing to the overall efficiency and balance of DeFi markets by aligning prices across different markets or exchanges.

The two major types of on-chain exchanges are Central Limit Order Book (CLOB) exchanges and Automated Market Maker (AMM) exchanges.\n","\n","1. Central Limit Order Book (CLOB) Exchanges operate similarly to traditional financial exchanges. They maintain an order book that lists all the buy and sell orders for a particular asset, and trades are executed when buy and sell orders match.\n","   \n","   Key features of a CLOB exchange include:\n","\t- **Order Book**: A ledger where all buy and sell orders are recorded.\n","\t  \n","\t  <img src=\"images/Orderbook.png\" alt=\"ETH-USD Perpetual's Orderbook on dYdX Exchange\" width=\"700\"/>\n","\t\n","\t- **Order Matching**: Orders are matched based on price and time priority.\n","\t  \n","\t- **Trade Execution**: Trades occur when buy and sell orders match.\n","\t  \n","\t- **Liquidity Providers**: Users place orders in the order book, providing liquidity.\n","   \n","\n","2. Automated Market Maker (AMM) Exchanges use smart contracts to create liquidity pools, where users can trade against the pool rather than matching with another user. Prices are determined by mathematical formulas.\n","\n","   Key features of an AMM exchange include:\n","\t- **Liquidity Pools**: Pools of tokens provided by liquidity providers (LPs). Each liquidity pool is a trading venue for a pair of tokens.\n","\n","\t  <img src=\"images/AMM_pool_by_Uniswap.png\" alt=\"Concept of an AMM pool by Uniswap\" width=\"700\"/><br>\n","\t\n","\t- **Pricing Algorithm**: Prices are determined by algorithms like the constant product formula (x * y = k).\n","\n","\t  <img src=\"images/AMM_Swap_by_Uniswap.png\" alt=\"Concept of an AMM Swap by Uniswap\" width=\"700\"/><br>\n","\t\n","\t- **Liquidity Providers**: Users provide liquidity to pools and earn fees.\n","\t\n","<br>\n","Since prices are discovered in a different way on each model, this creates many arbitrage opportunities between **CLOB x AMM** or even between two different AMMs."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["### Factors in a Profitable Arbitrage Transaction\n","1. **Slippage**<br>\n","   Slippage refers to the difference between the expected price of a trade and the actual price at which the trade is executed. In the context of an arbitrage trade, slippage refers to the price change between the time an arbitrage opportunity is spotted and the time the arbitrage trade is finalized on-chain. Slippage can occur due to various factors, including low liquidity, high volatility, or delays in transaction processing.\n","   \n","   - Liquidity: <br>\n","      AMMs rely on liquidity pools to facilitate trades. If a liquidity pool has a small amount of an asset, large trades can significantly impact the price, leading to higher slippage. In contrast, larger liquidity pools can absorb bigger trades with minimal price impact, reducing slippage.\n","     \n","   - Volatility: <br>\n","      High volatility in the market can lead to rapid price changes, increasing the likelihood of slippage, increasing the likelihood of slippage.\n","     \n","   - Blockchain transaction speed: <br>\n","      Due to the nature of blockchain, every transaction on-chain participates in an auction, where all users compete to see who will pay more to have their transactions validated first on the blockchain. Users can set a **gas price** for their transaction, where a higher gas price means higher resulting gas cost, but faster processing time of their transaction; a lower gas price means saving on transaction costs, but risking too long to complete the transaction and losing the arbitrage opportunity. Thus, an arbitrageur must always be looking for the best blockchain transaction price, balancing cost and speed.\n","<br>\n","<br>\n","\n","1. **Concurrency**<br>\n","   Trades must be executed as fast as possible to capture the price difference opportunity of an asset. This means that funds will need to be deposited on both wallets for the different markets so that the bot can do both the buy and sell transactions at the same time.\n","<br>\n","<br>\n","\n","1. **Costs**<br>   \n","   Profitability of an arbitrage trade also needs to factor in the blockchain gas cost, and the exchange transaction fees."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["## III.

An arbitrage trade will only be executed when the $\\text{price difference(\\%)}$ based on a user-defined $\\text{minimum profitability(\\%)}$ is reached.\n","   \n","2.  $\\text{price difference(\\%)}$ is calculated using the following formula:\n","   $$\\text{min. profitability}+\\frac{(\\text{gas costs + trading fees + revert overhead})}{\\text{order value}}+\\text{slippage buffer}$$\n","\n","3. The $\\text{revert overhead}$ is calculated using the following formula:\n","   $$\\text{avg. gas cost per reverted transaction} * \\text{revert rate up to the last transaction}$$\n","\n","4. The $\\text{slippage buffer}$ is a user-defined percentage enforced on AMM trades, which will fail a trade if the final slippage exceeds the pre-defined percentage.\n","\n","5. Trades in one arbitrage transaction will be executed only when both trades can be executed under predefined $\\text{minimum profitability}$ and $\\text{slippage buffer}$, through smart contract enforcement. If any condition causes at least one trade to fail, the transaction is reverted, ensuring that neither trade is executed.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["### Trading Environment Simulation\n","As the local Ethereum environment is forked from a fixed state, the project uses procedurally generated transactions of random trades to create a trading environment to test and optimize the performance of the strategy implemented.\n","\n","In order to mimic a realistic trading environment with different trader profiles and liquidity operation scenarios, four different trade simulation bots are created in `trading_env_sims`.
